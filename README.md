# Challenge 03 - JavaScript: Employee Payroll Tracker

## Your Task

This week's Challenge requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. <br>
This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. <br>
It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story

```md
AS A payroll manager
I WANT AN employee payroll tracker
SO THAT I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data
```

## Screenshots

## Functions of the Salary Tracker

Allow a user to add multiple employees to display on the page.<br>
The user will need to enter the first name, last name, and salary of each employee, then have the option to keep adding employees until they choose to stop.<br>
The salary will need to be entered as a number, otherwise it should default to $0.<br>
The input should return an array of objects.<br>
The generated array of employees will randomly select one employee, and log their full name to the console.<br>
The array of employees will be rendered to an HTML table.<br>
